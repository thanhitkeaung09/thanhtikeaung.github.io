Hi I'm Than Htike Aung and I am 24 years old frontend web developer developing useful websites for clients with many frontend experiences. I have been starting the developing carrier in 2020 and before it I took a duty of a graphic designer in our university when we published the university magazine by designing the content pages and sponser advertisement for three times. 

The clients and the sponsors that I designed for their website and content page are very satisfied concerning with their projects and happy to work with me.

These are my skills that I used for the clients to work perfectly their websites and the designs. Don't think too much to join with me. If you contact me, I gonna be the most reliable developer and I can do maintenance for your websites when you need me.\


I begin the developer carriers by studying the basic web design courses for one years in MMSIT One Stop IT solution.
MMSIT One Stop IT solution is software company that run the business for local and global companies.

After basic web design, I knew that I need more skills to start coding business for clients. And I studied the Special Web Design Course for about
seven months. In this courses, I got many skills used for professional web developing , just like

Using Css Frameworks and Javascript Frameworks
Using Design Tools

For further more professional life , now I am studying the Web Development Course , Backend Course. Although my title is frontend web developer , I also know about web security and backend languages as PHP, MySql, Laravel and databases.
